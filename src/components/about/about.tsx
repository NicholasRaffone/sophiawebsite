                        <p className="md:text-xs lg:text-[1rem] text-white my-1 indent-2">Bonjour! This is Sophia. I am a second year philosophy and visual arts student with a minor in music at NYU Abu Dhabi. I also love lifting and scuba diving! I currently hold four world records in powerlifting, and am an ACE certified personal trainer and PADI certified rescue diver. </p>
                        <p className="md:text-xs lg:text-[1rem] text-white my-1 indent-2">Art-wise, I have been doodling stuff for as long as I can remember. I did have a few years of technical drawing practice back in middle school, and dabbled with ink pen, rubber stamp engraving, watercolor, acrylic, and spray paints, but my full-blown passion for art did not blossom until my very last years in high school. In fall 2018, I moved from Shenzhen, China to New Jersey, USA. At that time, I was very much into topics regarding adolescent mental health, especially depression, self-harm and eating disorders, and wanted to create works that somehow uncover the pain we are going through. Till this date, much of my works still share the sentiment. </p>
                        <p className="md:text-xs lg:text-[1rem] text-white my-1 indent-2">Since coming to NYUAD in January 2021, I have had more time than ever immersing myself in artistic production. I work primarily with watercolor and ink pen, and sometimes work with acrylic, oil pastel, and colored pencils. I enjoy capturing the fleeting moments of everyday experience. Apart from that, Iâ€™m fascinated with striking yet aesthetic representations of pain, suffering and brokenness, and are very much inspired by classical paintings and religious motifs.</p>
                        <p className="md:text-xs lg:text-[1rem] text-white my-1 indent-2">Long story short, I like to draw stuff. In September 2021, I started doing freehand temporary tattoos with Leinka Ink (not sponsored, hopefully one day). In December, I picked up a tattoo machine, and started to practice on faux skin (and myself). Around mid-February 2022,  I welcomed my first tattoo client, and am greatly blessed to have many bookings since. Same goes for piercing.</p>
                        <p className="md:text-xs lg:text-[1rem] text-white my-1 indent-2">Anyways, I really appreciate you being part of my journey! Iâ€™m now open for tattoos & piercings bookings and art commission. Send me a message for consultation, and letâ€™s do some cool stuff together ðŸ–¤</p>
                        <p className="md:text-xs lg:text-[1rem] text-white my-1">Sincerely,<br/>Sophia</p>
